The phrase \"garbage in, garbage out\" is particularly applicable to data mining and machine learning projects. Data-gathering methods are often loosely controlled, resulting in out-of-range values (e.g., Income: −100), impossible data combinations (e.g., Sex: Male, Pregnant: Yes), and missing values, etc. Analyzing data that has not been carefully screened for such problems can produce misleading results. Thus, the representation and quality of data is first and foremost before running any analysis.[1] Often, data preprocessing is the most important phase of a machine learning project, especially in computational biology.**\n","### **If there is much irrelevant and redundant information present or noisy and unreliable data, then knowledge discovery during the training phase is more difficult. Data preparation and filtering steps can take considerable amount of processing time. Data preprocessing includes cleaning, Instance selection, normalization, transformation, feature extraction and selection, etc. The product of data preprocessing is the final training set.**\n","\n","### **Data Transformation: Data transformation is the process of converting data from one format or structure into another format or structure. It is a fundamental aspect of most data integration and data management tasks such as data wrangling, data warehousing, data integration and application integration.**\n","### **Data transformation can be simple or complex based on the required changes to the data between the source (initial) data and the target (final) data. Data transformation is typically performed via a mixture of manual and automated steps. Tools and technologies used for data transformation can vary widely based on the format, structure, complexity, and volume of the data being transformed.**\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ELJD4ZKYr6xi"},"source":["# **Data Preprocessing (Data Preparation and Data Transformations)**\n","\n","1.
